# SclerodermaMethylation

We conducted a pilot study on DNA methylation in Systemic Sclerosis (SSc). In this cohort, we recruited nine SSc cases and nine controls. We performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and profiled genome-wide DNA cytosine methylation landscape for each sample.

In this repository, we harbor de-identified CpG methylation beta values of all samples genome-wide (MethylationBetaValues_chr*.RData). We separated the large dataset into per-chromosome subsets. Each of the subset contains information of all valid CpG dinucleotides in all samples passing quality control of read depth on the corresponding chromosome.

We also harbor the de-identified demographic features (Covariates.RData). Samples are in the same order as all methylation profile data.
